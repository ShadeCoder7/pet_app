# Hope & Paws ‚Äì Animal Adoption Mobile App üêæ

Welcome to **Hope & Paws**! This cross-platform mobile application is designed to accelerate and simplify responsible animal adoption, providing a unified and accessible digital solution for shelters, foster homes, volunteers, and individuals interested in giving a home to abandoned animals in Spain.  
With more than 280,000 animals abandoned every year (Fundaci√≥n Affinity, 2023), our mission is to make a real difference through technology.

## üöÄ Project Overview

**Hope & Paws** centralizes all adoption processes, animal profiles, requests, and incident reports in a single mobile platform.  
The app allows standard users, foster homes, shelters, and administrators to work in a coordinated way, updating animal statuses in real time and facilitating transparent communication between all actors.  
It was fully developed as a final project for the Advanced Technician in Multiplatform Application Development (2¬∫ DAM).

**Demo & Task Board:**  
See all tasks, issues, and development progress on the [GitHub Projects Kanban board](https://github.com/users/ShadeCoder7/projects/2/views/1).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** Flutter (Dart)
- **Backend:** ASP.NET Core (C#)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Docker), managed via Entity Framework Core
- **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication (email & password)
- **Image Hosting:** imgbb (external URLs for animal photos)
- **Dev Tools:** Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, Postman, Git & GitHub, pgAdmin 4, Docker

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The architecture is modular and scalable, separating all core responsibilities:

- **Frontend:**  
  Flutter mobile app, handles all UI, navigation, user actions, API calls (HTTP/REST, JWT Bearer).
- **Backend:**  
  ASP.NET Core API, with a clean separation of Models, DTOs, Interfaces, Services, and Controllers.  
  Security through JWT validation from Firebase.
- **Database:**  
  PostgreSQL, fully normalized and deployed in Docker.  
  Uses UUID for all entities, with advanced constraints, triggers and automatic timestamp updates.
- **Image Storage:**  
  Animal images are hosted externally (imgbb), with only the direct URLs stored in the database.
- **DevOps:**  
  Docker Compose orchestrates the DB and admin tools.  
  Sensitive config managed with `.env` files (excluded from repo).

## üìù Good Practices & Git Workflow

- **Version control:** Git + GitHub, using feature/fix/chore branches and pull requests (GitFlow).
- **Commits:** Follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for semantic and readable history.
- **Documentation:** Code and API are well documented for maintainability and scalability.

---

## üîí Privacy & Data Protection

- All sensitive credentials and environment variables are stored in `.env` files (excluded from version control).
- User passwords are managed exclusively by Firebase Authentication; no password is ever stored in the project‚Äôs backend or database.
- The app is a prototype and is not available on Google Play or App Store; for local testing only.

---

## üß™ Testing

- **Backend:**
  - Unit, integration, and endpoint testing performed using Postman and automated scripts.
- **Frontend:**
  - Manual testing on Android Studio emulator; onboarding for new users included.
- **Test Data:**
  - Includes several test users, animal profiles, and example adoption requests.

> _‚ÄúThis project was created as part of my final year at CESUR, combining all my self-taught knowledge in Flutter, Dart, C#, and modern backend development.  
> My goal was not only to learn but to create something that could make a real difference for animal welfare.‚Äù_
